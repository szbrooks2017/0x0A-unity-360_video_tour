 ## How to install for Oculus
 - Download the apk from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pu4s7Mz5IJaDnjFYn4-646fqUYpP1Diw/view?usp=sharing)
 - Sideload the game into your chosen device using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).
 - Make sure **Unkown Sources** is enabled in your Oculus app on your computer--in Settings/General.
 - In your Oculus navigate to the 'Unknown Source' in your apps.
 - Launch and explore!

 ## Intended features
 - Buttons that can transport you from one 360-degree room to another.
 - Information points that offers more context of the space.
 - Music implemented.

## Needs to be implemented
- I could add a black fade to transition from each room to help the viewer.

## Challenges
- Learning how raycasters worked was difficult.
- Learning about Airlink or how to test was a curve.
- Learning about spatial relation to the camera to place canvases was difficult at first.
